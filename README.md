# CI/CD & Python Automation Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects focused on *CI/CD automation, Python-based operational tooling, and cloud-native architecture concepts*, developed as part of my  personal skill development.

# Project Overview

# Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline for Containerized Application
 
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Python application. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment workflow while reflecting real-world delivery and control practices.

Key Concepts :
- CI/CD pipeline design using GitHub Actions
- Automated build and test stages
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes deployment architecture
- Separation between build, validation, and deployment phases


Technologies :
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Python


# Project 2: Python Infrastructure Health Checker

This project provides a lightweight Python-based automation tool that simulates infrastructure health checks and generates a structured status report. The script can be integrated into CI pipelines or operational workflows.

Key Concepts :
- Python automation for operational tasks
- Service health reporting
- Structured output for monitoring and analysis
- CI-based validation execution

Technologies :
- Python
- GitHub Actions (CI validation)


#  Architectural & Technical Approach

Across all projects, the following principles were applied:
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Automation over manual intervention
- Reliability and repeatability of processes
- Architecture-aware technical decisions
- Documentation-first mindset

## Learning Objectives

- Understand CI/CD pipelines beyond tool usage
- Link automation decisions to architectural impact
- Develop Python tooling for operational support
- Strengthen system-level technical reasoning
